# --- [Reminder] ---
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
# --- [TAGS] ---
# Tag can be 
#    doc      (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    version  (version bump/new release; no production code change)
#    hack     (Temporary fix to make things move forward; please avoid it)
#    WIP      (Work In Progress; for intermediate commits to keep patches reasonably sized)
# --- Updating Template ---
