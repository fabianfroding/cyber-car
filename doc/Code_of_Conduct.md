# [Team 1]

## Collaboration

Repository Platfrom: [Github](link-to-github) & [GitLab](link-to-gitlab)
Organization Platform: [Trello](link-trello) (**Kanban Style**)
Communication Platform: Slack

**Practices**:

1. Master branch should only have working code
2. Dev branch should be reviewed before merging to master
3. Pull requests (PR) into Dev branch must be reviewed by someone other than the
person who made the PR
4. Naming conventions

**Roles**:

1. Customer = Christian Berger
2. Product Owner = TAâ€™s
3. Scrum Master = {{***decision***}}
4. Vice Scrum Master = {{***decision***}}
5. Developers = Team

**Process**:

1. 1 week Sprints
2. Weekly Planning
3. Establish a DOD
4. Review Development
5. Retrospect Sprint

## Communication in group

**Meetings**
***Note**: There should be a plan set before each meeting.*

**Weekly In-Person Meetings**:

1. A fixed meeting every {{***will be decided later***}} where we discuss:
2. What we have done
3. Obstacles we have faced
4. Update artefacts
5. Plan for upcoming sprint

**Daily Stand-Ups**:

1. The daily sprints will take place on a dedicated slack channel where we discuss what we have done, if there are any problems we faced and what we intend to do next.
2. Since members of the team may not always be able to meet in person, having a daily stand up on a discord channel provides flexibility.

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Call when misunderstood**: When texting gets too complicated, the team members should discuss the issue over a call instead of text.
2. **The bottle rule**: use a bottle (or some other object) to mitigate discussions in-person when too many people start talking at the same time.
3. **2 vs 2**: Voting is going to be a part of decision-making and solution-proposing. In case of disagreement and 2 vs. 2 votes, decision will be made by Scrum Master
